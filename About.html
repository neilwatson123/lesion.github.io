<p> <b> 'Where is the lesion? What is the lesion?' </b> </p>

<p>Neurology is often viewed as difficult by students and doctors alike. Despite this, neurological disorders are very common - globally, they are the leading cause of disability and the second biggest cause of death. </p>

<p>People consistently rate neurology the most challenging part of the medical curriculum. Reasons include the volume of material needed to cover, and the gulf between the basic science - particularly anatomy - and the clinical method: taking a history and performing an examination, then making a diagnosis. </p>

<p>This gulf should not exist. The clinical depends on the science. Doctors should not learn the science without any clinical context - they are not anatomists - while attempting a neurological assessment without anatomy is impossible.</p>

<p>This resource aims to marry the two. It takes the form of illustrative cases, all derived from patients encountered in my practice. It is dedicated to them, in the hope that their examples help people learn neurology - and that it will ultimately help people with neurological conditions. </p>

<p>It concentrates on focal lesions which produce clinical features that can be localised to a specific point - for example an area of cortex or a peripheral nerve. As a result, it is limited to processes that produce focal lesions. This is deliberate - these ‘pure’, solitary lesions are the best way to learn clinical neuroanatomy and localisation skills. </p>

<p>There is much more to neurology than localising lesions - but it's a good place to start, and a crucial skill for anybody seeing patients with neurological problems. </p>
