<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> RECOMMENDATIONS </b> </p>

<p> There are endless brilliant resources out there for anybody learning neurology, but here are things I've enjoyed learning from - and continue to do so. </p>

<p> <b> YouTube Channels </b> <p>

<p> Neuro-ophthalmology with Dr. Andrew Lee - a YouTube channel with many short tutorials on all things neuro-ophthalmology. If you struggle to understand skew deviation, ocular tilt reaction and the various INO patterns - Dr. Lee is your man. </p>

<p> Dr Marty Samuels - Video Atlas of the Detailed Neurological Examination. Well worth a watch - Dr Samuels, who is sadly no longer with us, is a fantastic educator. He beautifully demonstrates how you can effectively assess all sorts about a patient's nervous system through a casual warm-up conversation,. </p>

<p> Dr Peter Johns' videos on vertigo. Dr Johns is an emergency physician who has superb videos on all things acute vertigo, including the proper use of HINTS testing. </p>

<p> <b> BOOKS </b> </p> 

<p> Stroke Syndromes - Caplan & van Gijn. This is a brilliant resource - with encyclopaedic information on clinical neuroanatomy in relation to strokes, including important anatomical variations. 

<p> Neurological Differential Diagnosis - John Patten. A resource that is as artistically beautiful as it is clinically useful. It has aged well - the last edition was written in 1995 but the clinical anatomy is forever, as are Patten's insights. </p>

<p> Netter's Atlas of Anatomy. I discovered this as a medical student - it wasn't the standard book we were recommended. I much preferred the format and the diagrams are quite beautiful.<p/>

<p> Neuroanatomy: an Illustrated Colour Text - Crossman & Neary. An essential book. </p>
<p> Clinical neuroanatomy - Cohen ... <p> 
<p> Clinically Oriented Anatomy - Moore. I still return to this. It reflects my own view - the best way to learn anatomy is with clinically meaningful examples for context - and the best way to learn clinical is to link it back to the anatomy. They are one thing, and if we unified them better, people would be less 'neurophobic'. 

<p> McLeod's Clinial Examination. The neurology chapter is concise and provides an approach I use in daily practice.

<p> <b> JOURNALS </b> <p>

<p> The New England Journal of Medicine: Case Records of the Massachussetts General Hospital. Find all the neurological ones and work through them - you'll see how the masters break down complex cases and form a differential diagnosis. 

<p> Neurology: Resident & Fellow section. There are so many great cases which are broken down, including focusing on clinical reasoning and localisation. There are also lots of great mini features, such as videos of clinical signs, or educational snippets.  

<p> Some specific articles I'd recommend include: </b> 
<ul> 
<li> Chowdhury et al. Localisation in focal epilepsy: a practical guide. Practical Neurology 2021 </li>
<li> Many others including apraxia, visual fields, eye movemnets, ... </li>
</ul>https://pn.bmj.com/content/23/5/404 on parietal lobe 2023 


<p> <b> WEBSITES  </b> <p> 
<p> The Movement Disorder Society website - this is free for trainees/residents and has endless online content about Movement Disorders including recorded lectures and interactive tutorials. </p> 


<p> <b> PODCASTS </b> </p>

<p> Practical Neurology - case podcasts. The entirety of Practical Neurology is gold, and I've had the honour of contributing a few times, but the cases are fabulous if you want to hear clinical reasoning  at its finest. </p>

<p> The Neurophobia podcast. This is more of a promotion of something I contribute to with colleagues who host this. It is aimed at doctors early in their training (before entering neurology specialty training) who are interested in neurology. The aim is to make neurology less 'scary' by talking through real cases for learning. </p>
