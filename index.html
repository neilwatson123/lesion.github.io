<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> WELCOME TO 'LESIONS' </b></p>
 
<p style="line-height: 1.8;" "margin-bottom: 50px;"> 
   This is a website dedicated to the clinical approach to localising neurological lesions. </p>

<p> The site consists of interactive cases for you to work through and test your knowledge of clinical neurology and anatomy. </p>

<p style="line-height: 1.8;" "margin-bottom: 20px;">   
 The cases all require you to answer the two cardinal questions: </p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li> <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> Where is the lesion?</li>
<li> <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> What is the lesion?</li>

<p> You can work through the cases in any order you like, and as many times as you wish. </p>

<p> The <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> Approach </span> section gives an overview of how we approach the neurological assessment based on clinical features such as the distribution of symptoms and the tempo of onset and further evolution to answer our two cardinal questions.</p>

<p> The <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> Definitions </span> section includes a glossary of key clinical terms - anatomy, symptoms, signs, eponyms, and others. </p>

<p> If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to <span style="color: #C00000; font-weight:bold;">contact me. </span> 
<p/>
 
<p> Good luck and have fun! </p>
