<p> CT imaging showed no signs of acute haemorrhage. There were changes consistent with early 
ischaemic changes in the left hemisphere in the MCA territory, with subtle loss of grey-white matter 
differentiation around the insular territory, as well as hyperattentuation in the left MCA, confirmed 
on angiography to reflect an occlusive thrombus in the distal M1 segment all the way to the 
bifurcation.  Her carotids were both significantly narrowed by atherosclerosis. </p>

<p>Perfusion imaging indicated a small area of infracted ‘core’ and a large surrounding area of 
ischaemic, viable, ’penumbra’ - the ratio of the two was 4.6. This suggested a large area of brain 
under threat of infarction but not yet dead, supported by collateral vessels (for now) – amenable to 
rescue via reperfusion before the collaterals fail.</p>

<p>The patient was given thrombolysis with alteplase and underwent a thrombectomy, using a 
guidewire passed from the femoral artery backwards until within the cerebral circulation. The 
thrombus was retrieved leading to reperfusion in the recanalised vessel, with the restored circulation shown below.  </p>

<p>In the recovery zone the patient’s speech was improving and she had regained right-sided 
movements. She had a 48 hour hospital stay and was fully mobile and with full right-sided strength, 
but some minor residual hesitancy in speech.  </p>

<p>The cause was carotid stenosis, and she underwent successful carotid endarterectomy a week after 
discharge.  </p>

<p>At follow-up she remained well, with complete recovery of her speech and no residual disability 
whatsoever.  </p>

<b> Final diagnosis </b> 
<p>Left MCA territory ischaemic total anterior circulation stroke, presenting with hemiplegia, combined 
dysphasia and hemianopia, due to a left carotid stenosis – with complete recovery after reperfusion 
therapy </p>

<b> Key points:  </b> 
<ol type="1"> 
<li> Stroke is the chief concern in people with abrupt-onset lateralised neurological deficits, and 
timely recognition is key to maximise the changes of a good outcome  </li> 
<li> Ischaemia precedes infarction, and in some situations – mainly, the early period after onset – the collaterals can keep areas of brain supplied. These will likely fail in time, so reperfusing 
the main artery is crucial  </li> 
<li> Assessing people for acute stroke needs to be rapid and focused. The NIHSS tool is a reliable 
and quick method. In people who cannot communicate, macro-level shortcuts exist such as 
visual threat – but some aspects (e.g. sensation) cannot be tested without the patient’s 
communication.  </li> 
<li> This patient enjoyed a rapid and complete recovery post-reperfusion, but for other patients 
it is not always as successful - and it is not without its own risks either. </li>
