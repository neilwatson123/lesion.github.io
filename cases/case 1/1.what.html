<p> The onset of this was instant – mid-conversation. The neighbour arrived within minutes to check on 
her and found extensive lateralised features already present. They were probably there from the 
start – the patient can’t tell us.  </p>

<p>The three chief causes of sudden-onset neurological problems are stroke, seizure and trauma.  
There is no suggestion of trauma here even though the onset was not ‘witnessed’ – the 
circumstances the neighbour found her in did not suggest any injury at least.  </p>

<p> Seizures usually present with positive features – e.g. motor activity – though can leave post-ictal 
negative deficits (weakness, numbness) in their wake. Dysphasia can be both – i.e. an ictal or post
ictal phenomenon. Certainly post-ictal paralysis (Todd’s palsy) is an important acute stroke mimic. 
We can’t say for certain that this patient didn’t have a seizure – but she was alert when the 
neighbour arrived, which would be unusual.  </p>

<p>Stroke is the chief concern in any patient with abrupt-onset lateralised neurological deficits, and 
here seems extremely likely. The deficits all localise to the left hemisphere, and are in the territory of 
the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The combination of hemiplegia, dysphasia and hemianopia 
represents a left MCA total anterior circulation stroke (TACS). It is very likely that this is what has 
happened. The patient also is at risk of this due to age, diabetes and high cholesterol.  </p>

<p>If so, there is a lot to play for. If this is an ischaemic stroke, it likely reflects a large, proximal 
occlusion, and she has presented within a favourable time window for reperfusion therapies – to 
chemically dissolve and mechanically retrieve the thrombus. If it is a haemorrhagic stroke, intensive 
supportive measures can help improve her outcomes, even if they don’t have the same potency as 
the option for ischaemic stroke. And whichever it is, there’s a lot of disability that may need 
managing in the near and short-term, and a high risk of death.  </p>

<p> For this reason, every acute hospital has a ‘code stroke’ pathway to ensure such patients get rapid 
investigations and treatment – ‘time is brain’. This is exactly what this patient needs.  </p>
