<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> Where is the lesion? </b> </p>

<p> The key features here are </p>
<ol type="i">

<li> severe and combined expressive (she can’t say anything) and receptive (she understands 
very little) dysphasia </li> 
<li> hemiplegia including facial weakness (likely UMN pattern although testing the forehead is 
probably difficult with impaired understanding) </li> 
<li> leftward deviation of eyes </li> 
<li> right homonymous heminaopia. There are different ways to test visual fields, but most 
involve the patient’s ability to communicate – the threat test is the most primitive way to 
screen for a gross field defect.  </li> 
</ol> 

<p>This can all be attributed to a sizeable left hemispheric brain lesion, affecting 
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li> both frontal and temporal speech centres (dysphasia this extreme has to involve the cortex – subcortical lesions producing dysphasia are less dramatic) </li>
<li> the motor tracts (probably as far as the cortex but also likely subcortical)  </li>
<li> both optic radiations – or possibly even the right occipital lobe. </li>

<p>The leftward eye deviation reflects involvement of the frontal eye fields (FEF) in the left frontal lobe. Their role is to push the eyes away; normal eye position results from tonic activity in both, with equal and opposite force keeping the eyes central, while an FEF lesion leads to tonic push towards 
the lesioned side by the intact hemisphere’s FEF (in this case the right). This eye deviation is a 
bedside sign, but it can also often be seen on brain imaging as an additional clue.  </p>

<p>There is nothing to suggest the problem originates further down – and as above, the language 
problem implies this is cortical. </p>
