<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> Case </b> </p>

<p>An MRI showed a left pontine lesion suggestive of demyelination <b> (images A & B)</b>, in addition to multiple white 
matter lesions in the brain, including a juxtacortical ‘U fibre’ lesion <b> (image C)</b>, periventricular lesions, and 
cerebellar lesions. </p>

<img src="image.C.jpg" alt="Axial MRI", width=600>

<p> This was suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), meeting the criteria for <i> dissemination in space </i>. 
However, insufficient evidence was present to meet the <i> dissemination in time </i> criteria, so the patient 
underwent another MRI with contrast 3 weeks later. By this time, the pontine lesion was non
enhancing, while there were new, asymptomatic, enhancing lesions present <b> (image D) </b> - demonstrating 
<i>dissemination in time </i>. MS was diagnosed.</p>

<p>The patient was treated with B-cell depleting infusions, which were tolerated well, with a stable 
clinical course and no relapses, as well as stable imaging performed annually. The facial sensory loss 
gradually returned to normal, with only occasional intermittent cheek tingling and numb feelings. </p> 

<p>Two years after diagnosis, she paused her infusions for family planning and had an uncomplicated 
pregnancy, delivering a healthy baby. </p>

<b> Final diagnosis </b> 
<p> Hemifacial numbness due to a demyelinating pontine lesion as the first 
presentation of MS. </p>

<b> Key points </b> 
<ol type="1">
<li> New-onset focal sensory loss, evolving over days, raises concern for inflammatory demyelination. </li>
<li> Facial numbness is a well-recognised presentation in MS </li>
<li> There is a differential to consider for this presentation, so imaging is warranted; in some people the final diagnosis is idiopathic facial numbness after investigations return negative </li>
