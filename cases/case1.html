    <h1>Case description</h1>
    <p>A 59 year old man with no past medical history presented to hospital with 2 weeks of clumsiness in his right hand. </p>

<p>He had been in his usual state of health until one morning he awoke with right hand functional difficulties, for example with operating a computer or turning keys in a lock. This initially was not too bothersome but as time went on it had become worse. He was now struggling to use the hand even for basic tasks of daily living, including dressing, which was awkward. </p>

<p> On examination he was noted to have the following features: </p>
<ul>
<li> Mild weakness in wrist extension, finger flexion, extension, abduction, and thumb abduction </li>
<li> Ataxia in the right hand on finger-nose testing </li>
<li> Brisk reflexes in the right arm </li>
<li> Subtle pronator drift </li>
</ul>

<p> The rest of the examination, including cranial nerves and gait, was normal. </p>

<h3> What is the lesion? </h3> 

<p> The tempo suggests..blah blah blah more text about neurology.</p>
<p> We are now able to sum this up. </p>

<hr style="border: 0; height: 2px; background-color: #163E64; width: 80%; margin-left: 0;">
<h4> Clinical formulation </h4> 

<p> <b> Right upper limb ataxia, subacute onset, most likely due to a right cerebellar lesion - inflammatory versus neoplastic. </b> </p>

<hr style="border: 0; height: 2px; background-color: #163E64; width: 80%; margin-left: 0;">
<h5> Outcome </h5> 
<p> An MRI brain confirmed a 5cm cavernous malformation (cavernoma) in the right cerebellar hemisphere producing mass effect due to low-flow haemorrhage. There were  signs of fourth ventricle effacement and slight dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, indication possible early development of obstructive hydrocephalus. </p>

<p> The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery high-dependency unit and was given high-dose steroids and ICP monitoring. Unfortunately his condition deteriorated and he underwent urgent posterior fossa decompressive surgery which was life-saving. </p>
<p> After several months in hospital including neurorehabilitation he was able to be discharged home. 12 months after onset of symptoms he was functionally independent and had resumed working and driving. </p>

<p> <b> Key points: </b> </p>
<ul>
<li> Ataxia is due to cerebellar pathology </li>
<li> Ataxia is ipsilateral to cerebellar lesions </li>
<li> Ataxia sometimes presents as 'weakness' or 'numbness'; careful history and examination are needed to find the true problem </li>
<li> Cavernomas produce mass effect in the cerebellum and may lead to devastating haemorrhages </li>
</ul>
