<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> Outcome </b> </p>

<p>  MRI showed a lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere, with appearances suggestive of a recent 
haemorrhage surrounding an underlying lesion <b> (sagittal MRI shown below) </b>. A differential diagnosis was 
suggested, including tumour, but the imaging was thought most likely to reflect an underlying 
cavernoma.                          </p>

<p>  The patient was stable, so no immediate intervention was needed. He remained under follow-up 
with plans for a repeat MRI, in the hope that as the haemorrhage resolved the lesion would be more 
clearly visible.                         </p>

<p> However, he deteriorated 5 weeks later, with headache, vomiting, vertigo, worsening ataxia (walking 
as if drunk), and dysarthric speech.  CT imaging showed hydrocephalus developing.                           </p>

<p> He had an external ventricular drain inserted, and in the following days had a posterior fossa 
craniotomy and removal of the lesion, which was confirmed to be a cavernoma.                           </p>

<p>  He experienced gradual recovery in the following months, though still had some residual issues on 
examination at follow-up 6 months later.  A sagittal MRI following surgery is shown below, with the resection cavity visible.  </p>

<p>  18 months later, the patient has good use of the right arm, still experiences minor difficulties in 
writing, and in reaching for objects (e.g. glasses of water). He had residual difficulties with the sports 
he used to play.                         </p>

<b> Final diagnosis </b> 

<p> Ataxia and subsequent hydrocephalus due to cerebellar haemorrhage from 
underlying cavernoma                         </p>

<b> Key points </b> 

<p>                          </p>
<ol type="1"> 

<li> Cavernomas are often found incidentally, but when they cause symptoms these are usually due to haemorrhage or seizures (in cortical lesions) </li> 

<li> A minority are infratentorial, as in this case </li>

<li> In many cases conservative treatment is all that's needed - for example anti-seizure medications  </li>

<li> In some cases however surgical resection is required - for example significant haemorrhage  </li>

</ol>
