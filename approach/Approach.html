<p style="font-size: 26px; color: #163E64;"> <b> Overview </b></p>



<p> Patients come to us with symptoms of unknown origin. It is our job to localise these symptoms within the nervous system and then establish what disease process is underlying. We can't treat until we do this. </p>

<p>Two central questions underlie the neurological assessment, and give us a framework for assessing problems: </p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li> <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> Where is the lesion?</li>
<li> <span style = "font-weight:bold;"> What is the lesion?</li>
<ul>

<p>The first is about anatomy. To answer it requires knowledge of the structure of the nervous system and how clinical features relate to this. Neuroanatomy is vast - yet a lot can be achieved using a few basic rules. </p>

<p>The second is about pathology. It relies on the natural history of different disease processes, particularly onset and evolution. In general, this reflects underlying pathology reliably. </p>

<p>For focal, solitary lesions, this approach is vital. </p>

<p>It also applies to multifocal lesions. A skilled clinician can tell when a patient’s clinical features map to more than one site, and what those sites are. Examples include </p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Multiple sclerosis - with demyelinating plaques in multiple areas of the nervous system</li>
<li>Cardioembolic strokes involving multiple vascular territories </li>
<li>Motor neuron disease with neurodegeneration in multiple, separate body regions</li>
<li>Combined myelopathy and neuropathy due to vitamin or mineral deficiencies </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we sometimes see patients with disease affecting a diffuse area. Localisation applies here too - not to a discrete focus, but to an element of the nervous system, for example the neuromuscular junction, meninges, or peripheral nerves. Again, combining the distribution and the clinical features present allows us to identify such a process, whether neuropathic, myopathic, meningeal or other.  </p>

<p>Done properly, the neurological assessment allows us to reliably predict the likely cause of a patient’s symptoms. Most of this is achieved from the history, with the exam serving to fine tune the clinical impression. Investigations are then organised with specific hypotheses in mind. </p>

<p>Skipping the process of formulation - where and what? - leads to problems, not least inefficiency and waste. Investigation frequently finds incidental, irrelevant pathology. Localisation skills are essential to combat this - we localise before we test, and we do it after to ask whether the findings are relevant or not. </p>

<p>To do this well, we need the following: </p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: inside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Knowledge of the key anatomy in relation to clinical features</li>
<li>Knowledge of different disease processes and how they manifest </li>
<li>History-taking skills to accurately elicit key features </li>
<li>Sharp examination technique, and the experience to know what is abnormal, a normal variant, or due to technical difficulties</li>
</ul>

<p>This section addresses all four. We begin with <a href="Where.html">What?</a> </p>
